# 🏞️ Scene Classifier App

This project is a **deep learning-powered scene classification app** built using **PyTorch** for training and **Streamlit** for easy web-based image predictions.

It classifies natural scenes into categories like:

- 🌆 Buildings
- 🌲 Forest
- ❄️ Glacier
- 🏔️ Mountain
- 🌊 Sea
- 🛣️ Street

---

## 🧠 Model

The model is a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the [Intel Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). It achieves solid accuracy on test data and can generalize well to unseen images.
